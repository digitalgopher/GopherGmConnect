    <releaseNotes>!! What's new

Tweetinvi 0.9.0.0 does not just add new features, The new version does not just add new features, the API has been entirely re-designed in order to simplify the development and to increase the reliability of the product.
We consequently made important changes that will make previous applications not compatible with the new version. But let me explainâ€¦

!! You will love the Tweetinvi namespace

To ease the development we have implemented static classes that provide all the features existing in the Tweetinvi API. This imply that you should be able to develop your entire application only 2 namespaces:

- Tweetinvi
- TweetinviCore.*

These classes allow you to create object as well as interacting with them. The objects created will let you access all the features that can be related with this object.

Here is the list of static classes:
- *CredentialsCreator* (give you the ability to generate credentials for your users)
- *Tweet* (create, publish tweets)
- *User* (access information related with users)
- *Message* (check your private messages and send some)
- *Timeline* (access the different timelines existing in Twitter)
- *Search* (search tweets)
- *RateLimit* (know how much queries you can perform)
- *Stream* (access a continuous flow of information coming from twitter)
- *TweetList* (get information about your lists)
- *Trends* (get the latest trends)
- *SavedSearch* (access the searches you've saved)
- *TwitterAccessor* (perform your own queries)
- *Help* (access help information)
- *ExceptionHandler* (get information about exception that previously occurred)

!! Examples

// Get currently logged user
{{ 
var user = User.GetLoggedUser(); 
}}
// Publish Tweet
{{ 
Tweet.PublishTweet("Hello Tweetinvi"); 
}}
// Get all the tweets from stream
{{
var sampleStream = Stream.CreateSampleStream();
sampleStream.TweetReceived += (sender, args) =&gt; { Console.WriteLine(args.Tweet.Text); };
sampleStream.StartStream();
}}
// Publish a private message
{{
Message.PublishMessage("Hello bro!", "recipientName");
}}
